It’s always cool to think about what the future holds, and Web 3.0 is an exciting one. We are on what feels like the cusp of a new leap in how to use and interact with the web. 
Hence, this is a consequence of the many changes we see happening around us. The leap to Web 2.0 was prompted by a shift towards content that prioritized being servable on a mobile device given the invention of things like the iPhone in the early 2000s. 
What’s more, it also valued social networks like Facebook and Twitter as well as cloud-oriented services such as AWS or Azure. However, what’s exciting is seeing how popular technologies are not just coming to the forefront, but are also becoming key features in the type of content we find on the Web and how we digest it. 
Edge computing, decentralized data networks, and artificial intelligence coming together to create an Open, Trustless, and Permissionless internet sounds exciting, to say the least, so I can’t wait to see what the future holds!

India's Edits:
I'm excited to see how the rapid growth of both artificial intelligence and virtual reality shape the 3.0 era. However, I am concerned over the concepts presented in DAkerele's last paragraph. It's true that a more interconnected web will be more open, and that can be seen in a generally positive light. But the terms "trustless" and "permissionless" are definitely looming in a lot of people's minds. How will a more inconnected internet open our world and potentially expose more of people's lives?
